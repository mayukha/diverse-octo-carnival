# Diverse Octo Carnival - Progress Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### PHASE 1: Setup & Organization ✅
- Created project structure: `data/`, `results/`, `strategies/`, `scripts/`, `notebooks/`
- Initialized Git repo and connected to GitHub (mayukha/diverse-octo-carnival)
- Location: `~/Documents/diverse-octo-carnival`

### PHASE 2: Data Collection ✅
- Downloaded 3 years of data (Oct 2022 - Oct 2025) for 10 stocks
- Stocks: AAPL, JPM, JNJ, XOM, WMT, DIS, BA, PG, V, NVDA
- Data stored in `data/` folder (11 CSV files: 10 individual + 1 combined)
- ~752 trading days per stock

### PHASE 3: Exploratory Data Analysis ✅
- Created 5 visualizations in `results/eda/`:
  1. Normalized price movements (all stocks)
  2. Individual stock performance charts
  3. Risk-return scatter plot
  4. Correlation matrix
  5. Drawdown analysis
- Generated performance metrics CSV

---

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS
**Position:** Ready to analyze EDA results and discuss learnings

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and interpret the 5 charts generated
2. Document key learnings from the data
3. Design the optimized MA strategy based on AAPL learnings
4. Implement portfolio construction rules (max 5 positions, 20% each, FIFO)
5. Backtest the strategy
6. Generate performance metrics and compare vs Buy & Hold

---

## 📊 STRATEGY TO TEST

**Original AAPL Strategy (FAILED):**
- 10/20 MA crossover + volume confirmation
- Exit: MA cross OR -3% stop OR +8% take-profit
- Result: +50% vs Buy & Hold +850%
- **Problem: 8% take-profit cap killed returns**

**Optimization #1: "Let Winners Run"**
- Remove or significantly increase take-profit cap
- Let trends play out
- This is what we're testing on 10-stock universe

**Portfolio Rules:**
- Universe: 10 stocks
- Max positions: 5 at once
- Position size: 20% each (equal weight)
- Selection: FIFO (first in, first out)

## 🔑 KEY CONTEXT FOR NEXT CHAT

**Your Background:**
- Studying quant finance
- Testing trading strategies
- Previously tested 10/20 MA on AAPL (failed due to tight take-profit)

**Current Goal:**
- Test optimized MA strategy on diversified 10-stock universe
- Apply proper portfolio construction (not all-in on one stock)
- Understand what makes a strategy actually work vs just riding winners

**What You Need from Claude:**
1. **Explain the 5 charts** - what do they tell us about the data?
2. **Key learnings** - what should inform our strategy design?
3. **Strategy implementation** - code the optimized MA with portfolio rules
4. **Backtest & results** - see if diversification + optimization helps

---

## 💻 TECHNICAL SETUP
- Environment: Python 3.9, venv activated
- Packages: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Terminal: macOS, VS Code
- GitHub: Connected and pushed

## 📌 REMEMBER FOR NEXT CHAT
Start with: "I'm continuing the diverse-octo-carnival quant project. We just finished Phase 3 (EDA). Can you explain the 5 charts that were generated and what learnings we should take from them?"
